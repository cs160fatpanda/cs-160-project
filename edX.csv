5,NGI101x: Next Generation Infrastructures - Part 1,Explore the complexity and challenges of infrastructure systems (Transport Energy IT/Telecom and Water) in the 21st century.,About this Course Imagine how your life would be without electricity to power the devices you use at home and in the office without reliable drinking water from the tap without cars trains and air traffic without your mobile phone and without internet access. In many parts of the world we take the availability of these services for granted. Without conscious reflection on the technological systems that bring these services to where we use them we are becoming increasingly dependent on a secure uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy water transport telecommunication and information services. They create the conditions for liveability and economic development. However today's infrastructure systems are in a process of drastic change as they are becoming more and more web-based transnational and privatized while new technologies are on their way. The outcome of these changes is difficult to predict. In this course we will explore the challenges of infrastructure design management and governance for the future. Some of the questions that will be addressed: What are the major changes and drivers when it comes to infrastructure development? What makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future? How can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved? Will they become accessible for all global citizens always and everywhere? Will they remain affordable for future generations? Will they exhaust the natural environment? Will established infrastructure systems be disrupted by technological innovations? How about security and privacy? In this course you will learn to look at these challenges from a new combined engineering and social science perspective. We will explain for example how public values are expressed in infrastructure design and how regulation dictates technology choices. It is all about dealing with complexity in the design management and governance of infrastructure. If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's (next generation) infrastructures this course is an exceptional learning opportunity whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will highlight a large number of case studies. In the follow-up course starting in September 2014 you will have the opportunity to study a specific infrastructure in more detail and explore ways to improve its resilience security affordability and flexibility. What is the potential of so-called smart grids? How to design infrastructure for the smart cities of the future? The course is based on the results of an extensive and renowned international research programme titled 'Next Generation Infrastructures' (NGInfra).

8,SNU216B.226.1x: International Politics in the Korean Peninsula Part 1,An introduction to archetypes of politics and contemporary issues of the inter-Korean relationship.,About this Course Course videos are presented in Korean with English subtitles. International Politics in the Korean Peninsula reviews several archetypes of politics and introduces contemporary issues of the inter-Korean relationship. Video lectures will be in Korean with English subtitles. Discussions quizzes and other course content will be in English. This course is the first part of International Politics in the Korean Peninsula; the second part will start this Fall. The course is introduced with two cases where politics brought tragedies: the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and the political idolization in North Korea. These two cases provide a good answer to why we study politics. The central content of the course is organized into two modules. First it will start with several chapters from Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: 史記) Plutarch's Lives and History of the Three Kingdoms (한국어: 삼국사기; Chinese: 三國史記) to find out four archetypes of politics: value creation/distribution in a political entity conflict and cooperation among political entities development and maintenance of an identity in a political entity and leadership selection in an entity. The second module of the course will link the four archetypes of politics with contemporary issues of inter-Korean politics and political events in North Korea. These issues will include the Korean Crisis in 2012 the arms race between the two Koreas the power succession and the simultaneous (nuclear and economic) build-up strategy in North Korea and upcoming political events.

10,AUTONAVx: Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots,In this course we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation with quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation linear control and path planning.,About this Course In recent years flying robots such as miniature helicopters or quadrotors have received a large gain in popularity. Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation linear control and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings how to navigate along a series of waypoints and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation. This course is intended for graduate students in computer science electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. The course is based on the TUM lecture “Visual Navigation for Flying Robots” which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.

12,ECFS311x: Becoming a Resilient Person - The Science of Stress Management,This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself by learning the skills to manage stress and optimize wellbeing.,About this Course Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level whether it’s the pressure to perform in school or work relationship problems financial difficulties or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn’t bad but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds bodies and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking relaxation strategies choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep scheduling in fun and so on) in order to better manage stress bounce back quicker after a setback be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits develop stronger relationships with others be physically and mentally healthy and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life. The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is survive) but it is also about learning the positive skills strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy fulfilling and meaningful life (in other words thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills strategies and routines among early childhood educators. In turn resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing supportive and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life. By the end of this course you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person. Course goal: The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who: purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations is compassionate towards self and others demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity and focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life. Course supporting objectives: When you complete this course you will be able to: Describe why ‘functioning from the inside out’ is critical to becoming a resilient effective person Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life including but not limited to: Mindfulness practices Strategies to manage intense emotions Activities that induce positive emotions Clarifying important personal values (that is what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available yet promote well-being Describe why ‘practicing’ and integrating resilience skills into one’s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future,https://www.edx.org/course/uwashingtonx/uwashingtonx-ecfs311x-becoming-resilient-1652,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q7K0m9fziM,2014-05-06,9,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/resilience-262-136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, UWashingtonX,2014-04-17

15,SPU30x: Super-Earths And Life,Super-Earths And Life is a course about alien life how we search for it and what this teaches us about our place in the universe.,About this Course Super-Earths And Life is a course about alien life how we search for it and what this teaches us about our place in the universe. In the past decade astronomers have made incredible advances in the discovery of planets outside our solar system. Thirty years ago we knew only of the planets in our own solar system. Now we know of thousands circling nearby stars. Meanwhile biologists have gained a strong understanding of how life evolved on our own planet all the way back to the earliest cells. We can describe how simple molecules can assemble themselves into the building blocks of life and how those building blocks might have become the cells that make up our bodies today. Super-Earths And Life is all about how these two fields together - astronomy and biology - can answer one of our most powerful and primal questions: are we alone in the universe?,https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-spu30x-super-earths-life-1631,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuxgUWFF5C0,2014-05-15,6,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/small_banner_1.png,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, HarvardX,2014-04-17
16,ATOC185x: Natural Disasters,This course examines the science behind different types of natural disasters and our ability or inability to control and predict such events.,About this Course No region on Earth is immune from natural disasters. As we gain scientific understanding into the causes and nature of such phenomena we become better able to mitigate the effects of disasters. Yet as the world's population continues to grow an increasingly large number of people are at risk. This course examines the science behind different types of disasters and our ability or inability to control and predict such events. From this course the student will gain an appreciation of natural disasters beyond the newspaper headlines and will better understand how the effects of disasters can be reduced. There is an urgent need for people from all walks of life to better understand the scientific principles behind the occurrence of natural disasters. City planners need to know where and where not to site buildings. Politicians need to make scientifically informed decisions. Emergency management officials need to understand the nature of a potential disaster and ways to mitigate such an event.

17,USW30x: Tangible Things: Discovering History Through Artworks Artifacts Scientific Specimens and the Stuff Around You,Discover new ways of looking at organizing and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.,About this Course People make history through the things they gather create collect exhibit exchange throw away or ignore. Over four centuries Harvard University has amassed an astonishing array of tangible things—books and manuscripts art works scientific specimens ethnographic artifacts and historical relics of all sorts. The university not only owns a Gutenberg bible it also cares for Turkish sun dials a Chinese crystal ball a divination basket from Angola and nineteenth-century “spirit writing” chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau’s pencil a life mask of Abraham Lincoln and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History museums not only preserve dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old. By learning how and why such things got here you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. While this course will not draw on all of these items it will highlight several to give students a sense of the power of learning through tangible things. In the first section we will consider how a statue a fish and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard’s history and you will learn the importance of stopping to look at the things around you. In the next section we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory promote commerce and define culture.

19,FPP.1x: Financial Programming and Policies Part 1: Macroeconomic Accounts & Analysis,A course on the macroeconomic accounts their interrelationships and the analysis of economic developments.,About this Course How healthy is the state of the economy? How can economic policy help support or restore health to the economy? These questions are at the heart of financial programming. In our FPP courses you will learn the building blocks of how to answer to these questions. Financial programming is a framework to analyze the current state of the economy forecast where the economy is headed and identify economic policies that can change the course of the economy. In Part 1 of the FPP sequence presented by IMF's Institute for Capacity Development you will learn the basic skills required to conduct financial programming. The course presents the principal features of the four main sectors that comprise the macroeconomy (real fiscal external and monetary); demonstrates how to read interpret and analyze the accounts for these sectors; and illustrates how these sectors are interlinked. (Part 2 of the FPP sequence will cover preparation of a baseline forecast and design of an adjustment program.) During the course economists from the IMF will lead you through the accounts and analysis of an economy. Besides engaging with lecture videos you will answer questions on the concepts explained solve short numerical exercises discuss with fellow participants economic developments in your country and work with data for a hypothetical country. The reading material will be provided to you. Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country a professional working with economic data or you are simply interested in better understanding the developments of an economy this course will provide hands-on training on macroeconomic analysis. We hope that you will join us in this exciting journey!

20,Stat2.3x: Introduction to Statistics: Inference,An introduction to statistical ideas and methods commonly used to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples.,About this Course Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population? Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem. The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points" or "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ..." then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl's school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations the assumptions under which they are valid and the correct interpretation of results.,https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-stat2-3x-introduction-1533,N/A,2014-06-02,5,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/stat23_262x136_verified.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, UC BerkeleyX,2014-04-17
21,PH555x: Improving Global Health: Focusing on Quality and Safety,An introduction to the emerging field of global health quality. Challenge yourself to think beyond access to healthcare and question: ‘Access to what?’,About this Course Over the past two decades there has been an increasing realization that in order for healthcare to improve population health it must be safe effective and reliably delivered. Despite this realization the quality of care that the world’s citizens receive is not as good as it can and should be. The human toll of poor quality healthcare is substantial.  The most recent data suggest that poor quality healthcare is likely one of the top causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.  While there are a number of initiatives to improve health care quality in the United States and a handful of other countries broad evidence from high-income countries and emerging evidence from low and middle-income countries suggest that a global focus is needed. You will be exposed to key issues related to the link between healthcare and health and how the state of health systems and their quality across the globe is having a profound impact on the health of the world’s population.  At the completion of this course you will be able to: Define and refine key concepts around quality and its measurement Compare and contrast healthcare practices aimed at improving healthcare quality in range of settings with a global network of colleagues Implement tools and contextual knowledge to promote the delivery of safe and effective healthcare The course will run for eight weeks and consist of a series of conversations between Ashish Jha and experts in the emerging field of global health quality.  These conversations will span topics such as: the measurement of healthcare quality the role of leadership litigation and patient-centeredness. As a participant you will actively contribute to course content. We aim to make each session interactive collecting and responding to participants’ own experience with and knowledge of healthcare quality. Course exercises will inform real-time instruction the development of future course content and a strengthened understanding of the state of global health quality.,https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-ph555x-improving-global-health-1679,N/A,2014-06-02,8,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/improving-global-healthcare-262c136_1.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, HarvardX,2014-04-17

31,GG101x: The Science of Happiness,The first MOOC to teach positive psychology. Learn science-based principles and practices for a happy meaningful life.,About this Course We all want to be happy and there are countless ideas about what happiness is and how we can get some. But not many of those ideas are based on science. That’s where this course comes in. “The Science of Happiness” is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself—the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view spanning the fields of psychology neuroscience evolutionary biology and beyond. What’s more “The Science of Happiness” will offer students practical strategies for nurturing their own happiness. Research suggests that up to 40 percent of happiness depends on our habits and activities. So each week students will learn a new research-tested practice that fosters social and emotional well-being—and the course will help them track their progress along the way. The course’s co-instructors Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science feel fun and personal. They’ll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy mindfulness and gratitude—experts including Rick Hanson Barbara Fredrickson Paul Ekman Sonja Lyubomirsky and Jon Kabat-Zinn.

32,KIBehMedx: Behavioral Medicine: A Key to Better Health,Learn how to change everyday behaviors for healthier lives using basic behavioral medicine concepts. Test yourself with virtual patient scenarios.,About this Course Behavioral medicine is the science of changing our behavior so we as individuals can stay healthy and happy as long as we can. If you choose to join this five-week course on Behavioral Medicine you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with “virtual patient scenarios” will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self-help tools based on behavioral medicine for whatever you need to change in your life. We’ll start the first week by looking at what makes us motivated to change our behavior. We often feel motivated for change when we experience imbalance in life. One example of a key concept that helps us understand how imbalance arises is the effort-reward model which states that ill-health is more likely to arise when there is a gap between the effort you make and how you are rewarded. To help people who are experiencing imbalance identify what they need to change we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI) a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a “virtual bartender” who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following four weeks will focus on coping with stress (week 2) improving sleep (week 3) increasing physical activity (week 4) and everyday behaviors (week 5) like hand washing condom use and minimizing risky alcohol use. To complete this course you will need to set aside about 5-8 hours a week. You’ll use some of this time to watch course videos answer questions designed to help you reinforce and retain what you have learned and understand the homework required. The remaining time will be for course reading mostly open access scientific articles and solving homework tasks. You’ll be doing part of the work together with other participants in the course community. After the five course weeks you can expect to know a lot more about understanding unhealthy behaviors and how to change them for better health!,https://www.edx.org/course/kix/kix-kibehmedx-behavioral-medicine-key-1527,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_YaZY6mQrM,2014-09-09,5,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/behavioralmedicine_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, KIx,2014-04-17

Do you want to understand the world through data analysis? Start by exploring statistics with R! Skilled persons who can process and analyze data are in great demand today. In this course you will explore concepts in statistics that help you make sense out of data. You will learn the practical skills necessary to find import analyze and visualize data. We will take a look under the hood of statistics and equip you with broad tools for understanding statistical inference and statistical methods. You will also get to perform some really complicated calculations and visualizations following in the footsteps of Karolinska Institutet’s researchers. You are probably reading this course description because you know that statistics and statistical programming are essential skills in our golden age of data abundance. Let’s say it again: Health science has become a field of big data just like so many other fields of study. New techniques make it possible and affordable to generate massive data sets in biology. Researchers and clinicians can measure the activity for each of 30000 genes of a patient. They can read the complete genome sequence of a patient. Thanks to another trend of the decade open access publishing the results of such large scale health science are very often published for you to read free of charge. You can even access the raw data from open databases such as the gene expression database of the NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information. In this course you will learn the basics of R a powerful open source statistical programming language. Why has R become the tool of choice in bioinformatics the health sciences and many other fields? One reason is surely that it’s powerful and that you can download it for free right now. But more importantly it’s supported by an active user community. In this course you will learn how to use peer reviewed packages for solving problems at the frontline of health science research. Commercial actors just can’t keep up implementing the latest algorithms and methods. When algorithms are first published they are already implemented in R. Join us in a gold digging expedition.

34,IDB2x: Mejores Pensiones - Mejores Trabajos,Explora la cobertura de pensiones en América Latina y el Caribe y potenciales reformas previsionales para alcanzarla de forma universal en la Región.,About this Course En las próximas décadas las pensiones se convertirán en uno de los ejes centrales de las políticas económicas y sociales en América Latina y el Caribe (ALC). ¿La razón? En 2050 habrá en la región el triple de adultos mayores que ahora con una mayor esperanza de vida y por lo tanto mayores necesidades de atención. Esos adultos mayores del futuro están hoy en un mercado de trabajo donde sólo 4 de cada 10 trabajadores contribuyen a un sistema de pensiones. Esto significa que en la actualidad 130 millones de personas están trabajando sin ahorrar para su pensión en ALC. En ausencia de reformas incluso con un crecimiento sostenido en la región 1 de cada 2 jubilados no tendrá una pensión adecuada dejando entre 66 y 83 millones de adultos mayores dependiendo de las familias o del Estado para su manutención lo que será económica fiscal y socialmente insostenible. En este curso comprenderemos las complejidades que afronta el mercado de trabajo en ALC y por ende su sistema de pensiones. Vamos a esclarecer las políticas que se pueden formular en los diferentes contextos de la Región que podrían llevar a un funcionamiento de los mercados laborales más eficiente y así ofrecer “mejores pensiones” a todos los adultos mayores no solo a unos pocos. Better Pensions Better Jobs *This course is presented in Spanish. In the incoming decades pensions will become one of the cornerstones of economic and social policies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The reason? In 2050 there will be in the region three times more seniors than now with an increased life expectancy and therefore more needs of being taken care. Those future seniors are today in a labor market where only 4 out of 10 workers contribute to the pensions system. This means that today 130 million people are working without saving for their pensions in LAC. In the absence of reforms even with a sustained growth in the region 1 in 2 retirees will not have an adequate pension leaving between 66 and 83 million seniors or families depending on the state for support. This will be economic fiscally and socially unsustainable. In this course we will comprehend the complexities faced by the labor market in LAC and as a result in its pension system. We will elucidate the policies that may be formulated in different contexts of the Region which can lead to more efficient labor market systems and therefore offer “better pensions” to all senior citizens and not just a few.,https://www.edx.org/course/idbx/idbx-idb2x-mejores-pensiones-mejores-1614,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df30pDijgxQ,2014-09-16,6,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/idb2x_betterpension_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, IDBx,2014-04-17
35,D002: Representations of HIV/AIDS,We will explore how HIV/AIDS has been portrayed in diverse genres through the perspectives of the scientist and the literary critic.,About this Course This class engages students in a transdisciplinary conversation about representations of HIV/AIDS: in science writing journalism visual art literature drama and popular culture. We believe that scientists and cultural critics can learn valuable lessons from one another even as they create their own responses to HIV/AIDS. Today over 30 years since the first scientific reports of HIV/AIDS the pandemic remains a major health concern throughout the world. But rays of hope have led to speculation that an AIDS-free generation may be possible. In such a timely moment it is essential for us to connect across the "two cultures" as we consider the social and scientific implications of HIV/AIDS.,https://www.edx.org/course/davidsonx/davidsonx-d002-representations-hivaids-1383,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO7FiQwRf_o,2014-09-22,8,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/hiv-verified-262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, DavidsonX,2014-04-17

37,INTL301x: War for the Greater Middle East,Military historian Andrew Bacevich recounts the failed U.S. military effort over several decades to "fix" the Islamic world explaining what went wrong and why.,About this Course Over thirty years ago confident in the superiority of American military power the United States set out to "fix" the Greater Middle East. Since that time U.S. troops covert operatives and proxies have engaged in costly exertions in predominantly Muslim societies everywhere from the Levant and the Persian Gulf to East Africa and Central Asia. With what result? Washington's efforts have exacted a terrible toll squandering vast amounts of blood and treasure. In the meantime the Islamic world has become less stable while anti-American radicalism flourishes. America’s War for the Greater Middle East has failed and that failure is irreversible. This course offers a history of that war. It identifies the factors that inspired the United States to launch the conflict and to persist in a doomed enterprise. It describes how the war unfolded from one phase to the next from the era of Jimmy Carter to the age of Barack Obama. It catalogs errors of judgment and implementation made along the way. It invites students to consider alternative approaches to policy that might have better served the interests of the United States and of the people living in countries invaded occupied bombed and otherwise subjected to American punishment.,https://www.edx.org/course/bux/bux-intl301x-war-greater-middle-east-1556,N/A,2014-09-24,7,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/intl301x-middle-east-course-tile-262x136_verified.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, BUx,2014-04-17

Este curso – el primero de una serie de cursos sobre este tema - da respuesta a las anteriores preguntas y a modo de introducción brinda el marco conceptual de la gestión para resultados en el desarrollo con énfasis en los gobiernos subnacionales. En los siguientes cursos de esta serie profundizaremos en cada uno de los componentes del ciclo de gestión pública. Los países de América Latina y el Caribe enfrentan considerables desafíos de la gestión pública tales como el diseño de políticas públicas que tengan en consideración los puntos de vista de los diferentes actores; las demandas ciudadanas y los escasos recursos disponibles; la asignación de los recursos financieros; la calidad de los servicios públicos o el seguimiento y la evaluación de la gestión entre otros. La gestión para resultados de desarrollo y su enfoque de gerencia contribuye al abordaje de estos desafíos mediante el tratamiento integral de las distintas etapas del ciclo de la gestión pública el uso de la información para la toma de decisiones y el empleo de múltiples instrumentos y metodologías. *This course is presented in Spanish.  What is managing for development results? What are the components of the public management cycle associated with managing for development results? What are the main challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean for the implementation of managing for development results? How to assist the implementation of managing for development results in Latin America and the Caribbean? This course – the first of a series of courses in this topic – answers the previous questions and as an introduction provides a conceptual framework on managing for development results with special emphasis in subnational governments. In the following courses of this series we will go in depth in each one of the components of the public management cycle. Latin American and Caribbean countries face considerable challenges in public management such as the design of public policies that take into account different stakeholders’ points of view; citizen demands and scarce available resources; financial resource allocation; public service quality; and monitoring and evaluation; among others. Managing for development results and its managerial focus contributes to addressing these challenges through a comprehensive effort involving different stages of the public management cycle the use of information for decision-making and the use of multiple instruments and methodologies.,https://www.edx.org/course/idbx/idbx-idb1x-introduccion-la-gestion-para-1615,N/A,2014-09-30,6,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/idb1x_managing_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, IDBx,2014-04-17
39,ARPO222x: The Art of Poetry,The art of poetry gives pleasure and invites knowledge. This course is based on a conviction that the more you know about an art the more pleasure you will find in it.,About this Course The Art of Poetry as the title implies approaches poetry as an art. The assumption is that as with music dance film painting and photography this art gives pleasure. And as with those arts there is a lot to know. The music you choose to hear the picture you put on your wall are likely to become more engaging the more you decide to learn about them. This course is based on a conviction that the more you know about an art the more pleasure you will find in it. And conversely pleasure is essential to understanding an art. The Art of Poetry is not a creative writing course. You will not be asked to write poems. However you will be looking very closely at elements of craft sometimes as though through the eyes of a writer. The course is demanding and based on a certain kind of intense exigent reading requiring prolonged thorough— in fact repeated— attention to specific poems. A central idea is that you as a reader say the poems aloud or at least imagine saying them aloud. The purpose is to think what it feels like to say the words of a particular poem: to imagine needing to say those exact words chosen by for example Emily Dickinson or Gerard Manley Hopkins and to reflect on that feeling. The readings for this course will include historical poems as well as contemporary work. The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry’s historical relation to courtship; different kinds of repetition; poetry’s relation to music; the nature of greatness; techniques of sound in free verse—with only incidental attention to schools of poetry categories and trends. The Favorite Poem Project videos at favoritepoem.org provide a model for the spirit of this course. The emphasis on voice is not performative: that is as the videos demonstrate the most important voice is that of each reader saying the poem (actual or imagined) — not necessarily the voice of the poet or a trained actor. Students are encouraged to think truly carefully and passionately about what the poem says— that is thinking about what you as a reader feel yourself saying as you give your voice to the poem. Robert Pinsky says in the Preface to Singing School: “this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.” In a comparable way this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.,https://www.edx.org/course/bux/bux-arpo222x-art-poetry-1565,N/A,2014-09-01,0,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/arpo22x-poetry-course-tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, BUx,2014-04-17

41,ENG112x: Shakespeare: On the Page and in Performance,An introduction to Shakespeare that combines literary study with theatrical analysis to understand both Shakespeare’s continuing popularity and his greatness.,About this Course Shakespeare wrote for a popular audience and was immensely successful. Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare’s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare’s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare’s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include Romeo and Juliet A Midsummer Night's Dream Much Ado About Nothing Othello King Lear and The Winter's Tale.

42,HUMX421-01: The Divine Comedy: Dante's Journey to Freedom Part 1,Jorge Luis Borges the great Argentine writer said that no one should deny themselves the pleasure of reading Dante's Divine Comedy. In this course you will discover precisely what Borges meant.,About this Course Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Comedy which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question “who am I?” Dante as a Florentine a poet a lover and religious believer struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person. As a 21st century reader you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature history psychology philosophy and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the "MyDante" Project an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS) which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community you will reflect on both Dante's interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life. You the modern reader will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform you will learn to know yourself in your own historical personal and spiritual contexts as you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom identity and responsibility as a person. This module is the first of three modules that compose the full course. This module will take you through Vita Nuova and Inferno. Modules on Purgatorio and Paradiso will be offered in the spring of 2015 and will be available for registration in the future.,https://www.edx.org/course/georgetownx/georgetownx-humx421-01-divine-comedy-1549,N/A,2014-10-15,6,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/humx412_dante_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, GeorgetownX,2014-04-17
43,ASTR105x: Alien Worlds: The Science of Exoplanet Discovery and Characterization,Alien Worlds will explore the techniques that are used to discover and characterize the thousands of planets (called exoplanets) known outside of our solar system.,About this Course Have you ever wondered about planets in other solar systems? Have you ever thought about the possibility of life elsewhere in the Universe? For the first time in human history we know that planets around other stars not only exist but are common! Alien Worlds focuses on the search and characterization of planets orbiting other stars (called extrasolar planets or “exoplanets”). Over the course of nine modules we will learn some of the techniques used to discover the thousands of known exoplanets and will discuss how we can use basic scientific tools to characterize the sizes masses compositions and atmospheres of exoplanets. We will also learn about the diversity of stars in the Galaxy to understand how stellar properties affect exoplanet detection techniques and influence planetary formation and habitability. In addition to the exploration of exoplanets students in Alien Worlds will gain a basic understanding of light gravity and motion and be introduced to some of the most extreme life on planet Earth. We will hear from experts at the forefront of exoplanet science and interact with other participants and instructors through social media and online tools. Students will leave Alien Worlds with a better understanding of their place in the Universe and the skills to comprehend the wealth of new discoveries surrounding the countless worlds around distant stars.,https://www.edx.org/course/bux/bux-astr105x-alien-worlds-science-1569,N/A,2014-10-01,0,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/astr105x-alien-course-tile262x136_verified_0.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, BUx,2014-04-17
44,GUIX-501-01x: Terrorism and Counterterrorism,Examine the dangers and varieties of terrorism and assess effective counterterrorist responses.,About this Course Terrorism has gone from a persistent yet marginal security concern to one of the most important security problems of our day: indeed there are few countries that do not suffer from some form of terrorism. Though many terrorist attempts fail some groups wage lengthy and bloody campaigns and in exceptional cases kill hundreds or even thousands in pursuit of their ends. Course topics include the nuances involved in defining terrorism the nature of Al Qaeda Hamas and other important groups the effectiveness of different counterterrorism tools like detention and military force linkages (or the lack thereof) between terrorism and world religions like Islam terrorist recruiting counterterrorism and the rule of law the political context in South Asia and the Middle East and emerging issues like cyber-terrorism.,https://www.edx.org/course/georgetownx/georgetownx-guix-501-01x-terrorism-1373,N/A,2014-10-01,8,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/g_terror_262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, GeorgetownX,2014-04-17
45,UTokyo001x: Visualizing Postwar Tokyo Part 1,Analyze the history of change and development in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives using archived photographs films and TV programs.,About this Course Tokyo emerged out of the ruins of war to become a large city of 10 million people in only a quarter of a century. During this process of change the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces hosted the Olympic Games and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs documentary films TV programs and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1 you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation by the U.S. armed forces; 2) consumption of images of the Emperor and the Imperial Household and redefinition as the imperial capital; 3) construction of the Olympic city Tokyo; and 4) changes in Shinjuku as a site of chaos and diversity. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia such as Seoul Beijing and Bangkok at the end of the twentieth century. This course is a part of a joint course series on early modern and contemporary Japan entitled “Visualizing Japan” in cooperation with Harvard and MIT.,https://www.edx.org/course/utokyox/utokyox-utokyo001x-visualizing-postwar-1545,N/A,2014-06-01,4,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/utokyo001x_postwar_1_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, UTokyoX,2014-04-17
46,UTokyo002x: Visualizing Postwar Tokyo Part 2,Identify the geopolitics historically involved in the practice of “visualizing postwar Tokyo.”,About this Course The history of postwar Tokyo reveals an essential feature of the modern city i.e. the city as a place of visualities. In postwar Tokyo countless gazes fell upon others; gazes from and upon Americans and the Emperor gazes going up skyscrapers or rushing aggressively through the cityscape and gazes twining and wriggling among classes genders and ethnic groups in downtown Tokyo. In Part 2 we will focus on the geopolitics of these gazes in modern Tokyo. What kinds of gazes fell upon the war orphans the poor and the marginalized groups in Tokyo? How did students themselves who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo perform in front of these gazes? Moreover how did cinema or television shows as media for these gazes implicate the whole city? In answering these questions we will identify the geopolitics historically involved in the practice of “visualizing postwar Tokyo.” This course is a part of a joint course series on early modern and contemporary Japan entitled “Visualizing Japan” in cooperation with Harvard and MIT.,https://www.edx.org/course/utokyox/utokyox-utokyo002x-visualizing-postwar-1546,N/A,2014-06-01,4,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/utokyo002x_postwar2_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, UTokyoX,2014-04-17

48,KIPractihx : Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials in Health Care,Pragmatic randomized controlled trials reliably work out which of several healthcare interventions works best under real-world conditions.,About this Course For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine progress was a process of trial and error and to be honest it was often fatal error such as bloodletting which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood and where treatments obviously worked on most patients such as penicillin for pneumonia there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial. As the cost of developing new treatments grew it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease with perfect adherence treated by the best doctors under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases imperfect adherence ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions. In this MOOC we are going to study this mismatch and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically this drug intended to reduce a problem in individuals ended up causing more of the same problem in the population! After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost and how they are experienced by the recipients.,https://www.edx.org/course/kix/kix-kipractihx-pragmatic-randomized-1541,N/A,2014-06-01,6,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/kix_pragmatic_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, KIx,2014-04-17

50,ESRx: Energy Subsidy Reform,A course on energy subsidies their costs and the design of a successful reform based on country case studies.,About this Course Energy subsidies are an issue in practically every country in the world. Pre-tax subsidies which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy are high in many emerging and developing economies and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties these countries have tax subsidies where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform. This course builds on an extensive cross-country analysis which is reported in the recently published IMF book on “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications” to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy. In the first part of the course economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies and then describe the economic social and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first to review what works best in energy subsidy reform in light of country experiences globally; and second to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies. Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country or simply interested in better understanding issues related to energy subsidies this course will provide hands-on training on the design of successful reforms of energy subsidies. You are welcome to join us in this exciting two-week course! Energy Subsidy Reform is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.,https://www.edx.org/course/imfx/imfx-esrx-energy-subsidy-reform-1721,N/A,2014-04-01,2,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/esrx-262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, IMFx,2014-04-17
51,DSAx: Debt Sustainability Analysis,What are the tools to assess debt sustainability? How can countries effectively manage their sovereign debt? To answer these questions this course combines theory with hands-on exercises.,About this Course What causes a country’s debt to become unsustainable? How do we assess debt sustainability of public and external debt? How can countries manage their debt portfolio? This five-week online course aims to provide a comprehensive overview of debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and a medium-term debt management strategy framework adopted by the IMF and the World Bank. Specifically the course will: (i) introduce the main principles of debt sustainability; (ii) cover recently updated DSA frameworks-both for advanced and emerging markets and for low-income countries-with an emphasis on country data; (iii) present a medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) framework; and (iv) illustrate debt sustainability analysis under uncertainty. Whether you have a professional interest in debt sustainability or debt management or you are simply curious about these issues we hope that you will join us in this in-depth study of one of the most critical and current issues in economic policy today!

53,AT1X: Musculoskeletal Anatomy,Learn the anatomy basic to understanding common musculoskeletal injuries. Follow hypothetical patients from injury to operating room.,About this Course Musculoskeletal AnatomyX invites students to join basic science and clinical faculty at Harvard Medical School (HMS) to learn about several musculoskeletal injuries commonly seen in clinical practice. For each case students visit the HMS Clinical Skills Center to observe the initial patient encounter and physical examination by an orthopedic surgeon. Following the patient encounter students complete the interactive gross anatomy histology and radiology learning sessions essential for understanding the case. The anatomy learning sessions include observing actual dissections in the Harvard Medical School anatomy laboratories revealing and explaining the human anatomy relevant for each clinical case. After completing the case learning sessions students review pertinent radiology images commit to a tentative diagnosis from a list of differential diagnoses and accompany the patient to a virtual operating room to observe the surgical treatment.  In the virtual operating room students observe narrated videos of actual surgical procedures.

56,7.QBWx: Quantitative Biology Workshop,A workshop-style introduction to tools used in biological research. Discover how to analyze data using computational methods.,About this Course Do you have an interest in biology and quantitative tools? Do you know computational methods but do not realize how they apply to biological problems? Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: the Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give students exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. For the last few years the Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx we can give more students from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages students to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses. We expect that students from 7.00x Introduction to Biology – The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. So students with programming experience will find some weeks easier than students with only biology experience while 7.00x students should find the week on genetics easier than students without that experience. We recommend that students try to complete each week to find what interests them the most.

58,GSE2x: Leaders of Learning,Explore and understand your own theories of learning and leadership. Gain the tools to imagine and build the future of learning.,About this Course All of us carry explicit or implicit theories of learning. They manifest themselves in the ways we learn the ways we teach and the ways we think about leadership and learning. In Leaders of Learning you will identify and develop your personal theory of learning and explore how it fits into the shifting landscape of learning. This isn’t just about schools it’s about the broader and bigger world of learning. The education sector is undergoing great transformation and in the coming decades will continue to change. How we learn what we learn where we learn and why we learn — all these questions will be reexamined. In Leaders of Learning we will explore learning leadership organizational structure and physical design. The only requirements for Leaders of Learning are: an interest in the evolving world of learning; a curiosity about leadership in this new world; a willingness to examine your own beliefs about learning; and an openness to sharing your thoughts with and responding to others,https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-gse2x-leaders-learning-1729,N/A,2014-04-01,6,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/leaders-learning-262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, HarvardX,2014-04-17
59,8.MReVx: Mechanics ReView,Mechanics ReView is an MIT-level introductory mechanics class emphasizing a strategic problem-solving approach.  It covers the same syllabus topics as the Advanced Placement Mechanics-C course.,About this Course Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics. It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right) but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force and moves on to straight-line motion momentum mechanical energy rotational motion angular momentum and harmonic oscillators. Optional units include planetary orbits and a unit whose problems require multiple concepts to be applied to obtain one solution. NOTE: New Section “Problem-solving Pedagogy” We have developed a special approach to organizing the physics content knowledge and for applying it when solving problems.  This approach is called “Modeling Applied to Problem Solving” and has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness for improving students’ performance in a later physics course on Electricity and Magnetism. If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics or to learn new approaches to teach your students we encourage you to sign up.   Starting this year we’ll host a separate teacher discussion forum for teachers to discuss teaching ideas and techniques related to the topics discussed in this course.  To join these discussions  verify yourself as a teacher and we will sign you up in the teacher forum. Note that this forum is exclusively reserved for teachers so please do not register if you are not a teacher. Course Syllabus Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is an education research group dedicated to understanding and improving education especially online.  We showed that 8.MReV generated slightly more conceptual learning than a conventionally taught course  - but we were unable to find exactly what caused this learning.   (So far this is the only published measurement of learning in a MOOC).  This summer we will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that we administer to different groups of our students.   At certain points in the course new vs. previously used sequences of activities will be assigned to different groups.  We will then use common questions to compare the amount learned. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that neither group will have all new activities. Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects.  As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that: We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name).  The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has harder materials. Note: By clicking on this registration button you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the groups described above.  Welcome and we hope you will both learn from and enjoy this course,https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-8-mrevx-mechanics-review-1780,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ-7XZMqlSQ,2014-05-29,1,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/archimedes_lever_262x136_0.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, MITx,2014-04-17

65,TW3421x: An Introduction to Credit Risk Management,What is credit risk? Why is it so important in modern economies to correctly deal with it? This course combines theory with practice to answer these questions.,About this Course You are a bank and a big part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately for you lending money is definitely a risky activity: there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. For example you may expect losses in your portfolio because of the default of your counterpart. Or in a less extreme situation the credit quality of your counterpart may deteriorate according to some rating system so that your loan becomes more and more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Agreements credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks together with market risk and operational risk a bank (or another regulated financial institution) has to face when operating on the markets. As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to cope with it are fundamental in the world of today. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to credit risk modeling and hedging. At the end of the course the students will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management both from a theoretical and most of all a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For every methodology we will analyze its points of strengths but we will also stress its points of weakness. We will try to do this in a rigorous way but also with fun. In addition to the video lectures and exercises recent economic developments will be discussed in the forum based on news articles and key practitioners from the financial world will share their views through interviews.

66,PHLX101-01: Introduction to Bioethics,Introduction to Bioethics explores some of the most difficult - and fascinating - moral challenges we face in health medicine and emerging technologies.,About this Course Should we clone humans? Who owns our DNA? How much control should we have over how and when we die? When does medical treatment turn into medical enhancement — and should we care? Is rationing health care good bad necessary — or all of the above? This course will explore fundamental moral issues that arise in medicine health and biotechnology. Get behind the headlines — and polarized debates — and join others who want to think deeply and openly about these problems. Some are as old as life itself: the vulnerability of illness the fact of death. Some are new brought on by a dizzying pace of technology that can unsettle our core ideas about human nature and our place in the world. And nearly all intersect with issues of racial and gender equality as well as policies affecting the world’s most vulnerable populations. Designed to introduce students to the range of issues that define bioethics together with core concepts and skills this course should be of interest to undergraduates health care professionals policy makers and anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.

67,Stat2.2x: Introduction to Statistics: Probability,An introduction to probability with the aim of developing probabilistic intuition as well as techniques needed to analyze simple random samples.,About this Course Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1 does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen "just by chance"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course. We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples discuss the factors that affect their accuracy and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions. Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you're really good at counting cards in which case you could try blackjack but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you'll find other ways of earning money.) As Stat2.2x is part of a series the basic prerequisites are the same as those for Stat2.1x: high school arithmetic and good comprehension of English. In addition you are expected to know the material of Stat2.1x with particular emphasis on histograms averages SDs and the normal curve. The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations the assumptions under which they are valid and the correct interpretation of results.,https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-stat2-2x-introduction-1534,N/A,2014-04-14,5,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/stat22_262x136_verified.png,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, UC BerkeleyX,2014-04-17
68,001x: The Chemistry of Life,Learn how to generate ideas at the interface between chemistry and biology.,About this Course Chemistry and biology are traditionally taught as separate subjects at the high school level where students memorize fundamental scientific principles that are universally accepted. However at the university level and in industry we learn that science is not as simple as we once thought. We are constantly confronted by questions about the unknown and required to use creative integrated approaches to solve these problems. By bringing together knowledge from multidisciplinary fields we are empowered with the ability to generate new ideas. The goal of this course is to develop skills for generating new ideas at the interface between chemistry and biology by analyzing pioneering studies. Top performing students will have an opportunity to obtain MEXT Scholarships for postgraduate studies at Kyoto University. In addition Kyoto University plans to offer travel awards to five students with the highest interim scores who are interested in visiting Kyoto University for a week during summer.,https://www.edx.org/course/kyotoux/kyotoux-001x-chemistry-life-858,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4-6QnqAlrg,2014-04-10,1,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/ku_chem_262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, KyotoUx,2014-04-17
69,6.SFMx: Street-Fighting Math,Teaches as the antidote to rigor mortis the art of educated guessing and opportunistic problem solving.,About this Course Too much mathematical rigor teaches rigor mortis: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result. Instead of paralysis have courage: Shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy and the theme of this course: how to guess answers without a proof or an exact calculation in order to develop insight. You will learn this skill by mastering six reasoning tools---dimensional analysis easy cases lumping pictorial reasoning taking out the big part and analogy. The applications will include mental calculation estimating population growth rates understanding drag without differential equations singing musical intervals to estimate logarithms approximating integrals summing infinite series and turning differential equations into algebra. Your learning will be supported by regular readings that you discuss with other students by short tablet videos by quick problems to help you check your understanding by weekly homework problems review and and a final exam. You will work hard and by the end of the course have learned a rough-and-ready approach to using mathematics to understand the world.

72,HYPERS301x: Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets,Understand flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and discover how to analyse the performance of a scramjet.,About this Course A flow is called hypersonic if the Mach number is greater than 5. This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature the speed of sound is around 340 m/s so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet) hypersonic flows are encountered. Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets introduces the basic concepts associated with flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and takes students to the stage where they can analyse the performance of a scramjet engine that might be used in a future access-to-space system.,https://www.edx.org/course/uqx/uqx-hypers301x-hypersonics-shock-waves-1435,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQ1KE69PZA,2014-04-07,9,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/hypersonics-verified-262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, UQx,2014-04-17

105,6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python,6.00.1x is an introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems.,About this Course This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python covers the notion of computation the Python programming language some simple algorithms testing and debugging and informal introduction to algorithmic complexity and some simple algorithms and data structures. Recommended textbook. The recommended textbook for this course is: Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python Revised and Expanded edition by John Guttag (MIT Press 2013).

106,UT.9.01x: Effective Thinking Through Mathematics,Learn tools of effective thinking through puzzles and the world of mathematics around you in this fun and fascinating course.,About this Course A wondrously romantic belief is that brilliant thinkers magically produce brilliant ideas: Einstein jostles his hair and relativity falls out. We can enjoy these fanciful visions of leaps of genius but we should not be fooled into believing that they’re reality. Brilliant innovators are brilliant because they practice habits of thinking that inevitably carry them step by step to works of genius. No magic and no leaps are involved. Professor Starbird will discuss how habits of effective thinking and creativity can be taught and learned through mathematics. Anyone who practices them will inevitably create new insights new ideas and new solutions.

Qu’est-ce que le pouvoir dans une société ‘multi-échelles’ ? L’État demeure-t-il un acteur politique majeur s’il est concurrencé par des organisations internationales et régionales ? La démocratie prônée par la communauté internationale peut-elle coexister avec des régimes autoritaires voire totalitaires? Quel est le rôle des citoyens face aux idéologies ? Le cours vise à comprendre et à expliquer des phénomènes politiques à partir d’une posture d’analyse critique. A la fin du cours vous serez capables de : Définir et expliquer des concepts en science politique. Mettre en lien les concepts avec leurs auteurs et plus largement les phénomènes concrets qu'ils désignent. Amorcer des analyses objectives de phénomènes politiques basées sur les connaissances acquises.  Avant pendant et après le cours consultez les pages Facebook et Google+ pour les annonces et les discussions. Politics impact all of us: everyday political decisions concern many areas of our lives. In which context are these decisions made? In the 21st century many paradoxes blur our vision of these decisions. What is power in a multi-level society? Does the state remain the main political actor if it is in competition with international and regional organizations? Can democracy – pushed forward by the international community – coexist with authoritarian or even totalitarian regimes? What is the role of citizens in regard to ideologies?

117,6.041x: Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty,An introduction to probabilistic models including random processes and the basic elements of statistical inference.,About this Course The world is full of uncertainty: accidents storms unruly financial markets noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions. Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore while the applications are multiple and evident we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable. The course covers all of the basic probability concepts including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables expectations and conditional distributions laws of large numbers the main tools of Bayesian inference methods an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains) The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.,https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-041x-introduction-probability-1296,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5embKsb2g,2014-02-04,1,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/6.041x_262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, MITx,2014-04-17

Students are welcome to audit the course and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued. This course is designed to help you become a more effective and confident public speaker. We will demystify the process of writing practicing and performing a clear and engaging speech work through the unique traits of oral versus written communication and learn how to prepare speeches that are easier to deliver orally and understand aurally. One of the best ways to refine your own speech ability is through a close study of others' speeches. We will have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches and speakers. Growing out of our analysis of speakers we will discuss who you hold up as a model speaker and analyze what makes that speaker effective. We will critically examine our own speeches and the speeches of others. By becoming a student of public speaking you join a long history of rhetorical study dating back to ancient Greece. By the end of this course you should be able to: Design and deliver basic arguments clearly. Design and deliver informative presentations clearly. Design and deliver complex arguments persuasively. Speak confidently with appropriate rate projection movement and vocal variety. Evaluate and critique speeches insightfully. This course is being offered in an experimental format.

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioural economics and allows the student to develop a hands-on approach by learning its methods and more importantly how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to “nudge” choice. In three modules students will be able to a) explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behaviour change b) learn how to critique design and interpret experiments; and c) design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions.  Students will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on topics like “does irrationality impact welfare?” or “Is nudging manipulative?” If you’ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioural economics but are not sure how to actually use it this course is for you. Guest Appearances:  Several leading scholars policy makers businesspeople and commentators will make short appearances in our debate and discussion sections. These guests include Professor Sendhil Mullainathan (Harvard University) Professor John Lynch (University of Colorado) Rory Sutherland (Ogilvy Group) Owain Service (Behavioural Insights Team UK Cabinet Office) Shankar Vedantam (NPR Columnist and Author – The Hidden Brain) Professors Andrew Ching Avi Goldfarb Nina Mazar and Claire Tsai (University of Toronto) and many others!

145,SPU27x: Science & Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science,Top chefs and Harvard researchers explore how everyday cooking and haute cuisine can illuminate basic principles in physics and engineering and vice versa.,About this Course During each week of the course you will watch as chefs reveal the secrets behind some of their most famous culinary creations — often right in their own restaurants. Inspired by such cooking mastery the Harvard team will then explain in simple and sophisticated ways the science behind the recipe. Topics will include: soft matter materials such as emulsions illustrated by aioli; elasticity exemplified by the done-ness of a steak; and diffusion revealed by the phenomenon of spherification the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adrià. To help you make the link between cooking and science an “equation of the week” will capture the core scientific concept being explored. You will also have the opportunity to be an experimental scientist in your very own laboratory — your kitchen. By following along with the engaging recipe of the week taking measurements and making observations you will learn to think both like a cook and a scientist. The lab is also one of the most unique components of this course — after all in what other science course do you get to eat your lab?

COURSE OVERVIEW Iran’s nuclear ambitions the slaughter in Syria’s civil war WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information — these are among the challenges American national security students in 211x will wrestle with this year.  This introduction is based on one of the most popular and dynamic courses taught at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. In each case students are cast as a trusted NSC staffer to President Obama or to another principal in the policy-making process.  Each case requires not only reexamining current U.S. strategy but also identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests. In each of these cases which include a special two-week segment on the disclosures surrounding NSA surveillance and the trove of WikiLeaks documents of previously-secret American policymaking participants have to operate in the rough-and-tumble of a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks reports about internal differences among policymakers and press analyses. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo” that combines careful analysis and strategic imagination on the one hand with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support on the other. They also examine how policymaking is affected by constant public analysis of government deliberations.,https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hks211-1x-central-challenges-1087,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKsju_u9_0,2013-10-01,8,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/hks211x_course_tile262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, HarvardX,2014-04-17

Make sure to check for reruns of this course. As contemporary humans we are a product of our evolutionary past. That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record the materials preserved for archaeological study and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes the rise and fall of the Australopithecines the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.

Make sure to check for reruns of this course. How do we understand architecture? One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history. This course will examine architecture through time beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological it is not intended as a linear narrative but rather aims to provide a more global view by focusing on different architectural "moments." The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations such as Buddhism and Hinduism produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address. All required readings are available within the courseware courtesy of Wiley. Print or electronic versions of the A Global History of Architecture Second Edition and Architecture of First Societies are also available for purchase. The course is aimed for a general audience at the undergraduate level with an interest in history. All lectures will be in English.

159,CTB3365x: Introduction to Water Treatment,Learn about urban water services focusing on basic drinking water and wastewater treatment technologies,About this Course *Note - This is an Archived course* This is a past/archived course. At this time you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course. This course will detail urban water services focusing on basic drinking water and wastewater treatment technologies. Unit processes involved in the two treatment chains will be described as well as the physical chemical and biological processes involved. There will be an emphasis on water quality and the functionality of each unit process within the treatment chain.  After the course one should be able to recognise the process units describe their function and make simple design calculations on water treatment  plants (drinking and waste water).  Overall the course will teach the role of treatment technologies in providing adequate water supply and effective sanitation which are essential for human society and the safeguarding of public and environmental health. There is a global trend towards urbanisation with over 50% of humanity currently residing in urban areas. Water is invariably linked to urban functionality as industrial domestic and agricultural use. Essential services such as drinking water supply sanitation and wastewater treatment to protect surface water and groundwater resources need to be present in such environment. The provision of these essential urban water services present real challenges in many parts of the world today. Accessible fresh water resources suitable for drinking water and other ecosystem services is approximated to be 200000 km3 approximately 0.3% of the total freshwater resources and less than 0.01% of the total water on earth. These accessible freshwater resources are not equally distributed and many countries today are experiencing water scarcity which in turn affects community health and in many places water scarcity is the inhibiting factor for economic growth. This highlights the importance of conserving and protecting the accessible freshwater resources through the implementation of adequate treatment technologies combined with a robust infrastructure. Through utilising relevant treatment technologies to upgrade water to a quality suitable for subsequent use or discharge with more and more stringent effluent demands the urban water chain has the possibility to transform to an urban water cycle and improve interactions within the greater hydrological cycle.

The course covers the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics fluid mechanics and kinetic gas theory. A variety of other interesting topics are covered such as resonance phenomena musical instruments and astronomical phenomena such as binary stars neutron stars black holes stellar collapse and supernovae. You will also be given a peek into the intriguing world of quantum mechanics. The course follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the fall of 1999. This includes his video lectures problem solving sessions and of course his famous in-class demonstrations. Professor Lewin proclaimed "a Web Star" by The New York Times has supplemented his lectures by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves. You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and exams to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions to be answered. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the interactive questions during the lectures (10%) homework problems (15%) three midterm exams (15% each) and the final exam (30%). Your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%) B (70-85%) C (60-70%). At least 60% must be obtained to qualify for a certificate. The book is available on line without charge but you can also buy a printed copy of the book (publisher Wiley). Since the book is a record of things you will soon forget Professor Lewin recommends you buy the book if you can afford it. ABOUT THE LECTURES Lewin's lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs were aired 24 hours per day and were frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT'S OpenCourseWare iTunes U YouTube and Academic Earth. About 5000 people daily from all over the world watch these lectures - that's about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their classrooms. Bill Gates even wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once and he has learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.

166,CB22.1x: The Ancient Greek Hero,A survey of ancient Greek literature focusing on classical concepts of the hero and how they can inform our understanding of the human condition.,About this Course *Note - This is an Archived course* This is a past/archived course.

Make sure to check for reruns of this course. What is it to be human and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging highly comparative way. The classical Greeks' concepts of Heroes and the "heroic" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general. In Greek tradition a hero was a human male or female of the remote past who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans but on a much larger scale. Further despite their mortality heroes like the gods were objects of cult worship – a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course. The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue "On Heroes" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach's opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott's science fiction classic Blade Runner). The true hero of the course is the logos ("word") of reasoned expression as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or "slow") reading which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer's epics and ends with Plato's memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations. Using modern technology and engaging texts The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature its myths and its ritual practices.

Quantum computation is a remarkable subject building on the great computational discovery that computers based on quantum mechanics are exponentially powerful. This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject including entanglement non-local correlations the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms including the quantum fourier transform period finding Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population?   Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.   The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points" or "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ..." then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl's school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.   The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations the assumptions under which they are valid and the correct interpretation of results.,https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-stat2-3x-introduction-825,N/A,2013-07-19,5,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/stat23_262x136.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, UC BerkeleyX,2014-04-17

Make sure to check for reruns of this course. Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics. It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right) but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force and moves on to straight-line motion momentum mechanical energy rotational motion and angular momentum. Optional units include oscillations planetary orbits and a review of multi-concept problems. Why Take Our Course? Our approach to mechanics is a unique one. Through worked examples and online texts we introduce a strategic overview of core concepts in mechanics. This overview couples with a new approach to problem-solving that will help you break down and solve multi-concept problems. By choosing a system of objects defining their interactions and deciding on a model to use to describe them you will come to solve physics problems more easily and more systematically. The road to "easy" goes through "hard." This course is more challenging than a standard high school or introductory college physics offering. We will help you become a more expert problem solver and that process involves solving a variety of problems in many different ways with our new approach. The reward is stronger problem-solving ability that carries over to other areas in physics. Take this course to better organize your mechanics knowledge to prepare for AP or advanced standing exams to teach more effectively or if you enjoy attacking challenging problems! For Teachers If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics or to learn new approaches to teach your students we encourage you to sign up. Our approach has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness when it comes to preparing students for later courses. Teachers in the United States and especially in Massachusetts can receive extra benefit from this course.

Passing the online version of this course will guarantee you an MITx certificate of achievement The course is on electricity and magnetism which are at the heart of Maxwell's equations. We will study electric fields magnetic fields electromagnetic forces conductors and dielectrics electromagnetic waves and the nature of light. This online version follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the spring of 2002 and includes his video lectures and problem solving sessions. Professor Lewin proclaimed "a Web Star" by The New York Times has supplemented his lectures specifically for 8.02x by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves. Also the course uses prize-winning animations and interactive simulations developed under the leadership of Professor John Belcher for MIT's Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) classroom. In addition to the basic concepts of Electromagnetism a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course including: Lightning Electric Shock Treatment Electrocardiograms Metal Detectors Musical Instruments Magnetic Levitation Bullet Trains Electric Motors Radios TV Car Coils Superconductivity Aurora Borealis Rainbows Radio Telescopes Interferometers Particle Accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider Mass Spectrometers Red Sunsets Blue Skies Haloes around Sun and Moon Color Perception Doppler Effect Big-Bang Cosmology. You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and a series of exams using multiple choice numerical and symbolic questions to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions that must be answered before advancing to the next lecture segment. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on interactive questions during the lectures (5%) homework problems and simulations (20%) three midterm exams (15% each) and the final exam (30%). Depending on what percentage of all the points you get your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%) B (70-85%) C (60-70%). At least 60% of the points must be obtained to qualify for a certificate of mastery. ABOUT THE LECTURES Lewin's lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs which were aired 24 hours per day were also frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT'S OpenCourseWare iTunes U YouTube and Academic Earth. These lectures are being watched by about 5000 people daily from all over the world that's about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their class rooms and Bill Gates wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once and that he learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.,https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-8-02x-electricity-magnetism-608,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxSLwndRNDI,2013-02-18,1,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/8.02x-listing-banner.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, MITx,2014-04-17

Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard School of Public Health's classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer with measured uncertainty the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants study design options bias and confounding probability and diagnostic tests confidence intervals and hypothesis testing power and sample size determinations life tables and survival methods regression methods (both linear and logistic) and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.,https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-ph207x-health-numbers-354,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9CqWffkVNw,2012-10-15,1,https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/ph207x-listing-banner.jpg,N/A,https://edx.org/,0,English,yes, HarvardX,2014-04-17
