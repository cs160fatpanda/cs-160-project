Syllabus:   Week 1: Strategy   Strategy is the long-term direction and scope of an organization as that organization pursues advantage through its configuration of resources to meet the needs of markets and to fulfill stakeholder expectations (Johnson and Scholes 2006). Corporate strategy addresses which business a corporation will participate in and business strategy focuses on how a particular business competes within its industry.   Week 2: Entrepreneurship   Shane and Venkataraman (2000 p. 218) define the academic field of entrepreneurship as the “scholarly examination of how by whom and with what effects opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered evaluated and exploited.” Why do some people and not others discover and exploit the opportunities that are the heart of entrepreneurship?   Week 3: Leadership   Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal. We look at competing views of what leaders should do what they actually do how leaders establish organizational culture and what are the elements of constructive leadership.   Week 4: Organization and Processes   Organizational design is the alignment of structure process rewards metrics and talent with the strategy of the business. In this chapter we describe what has (and has not) been established to promote organizational effectiveness.   Week 5: International Business   All companies—even new companies in new industries—must consider the global environment in which they operate. Key international business literature addresses dimensions such as theories of multinational enterprises international political economy multinational management and culture. These dimensions provide managers with tools and concepts needed for growing beyond national borders.   Week 6: Innovation   Contexts for innovation vary based on location industry and country. We look here at how innovation diffuses or spreads and thus how current technology such as the web and social media might affect the adoption of innovative outputs. It is essential that managers understand the contexts for innovation at the firm industry and country levels in creating and managing innovation strategies.   Week 7: Finance   Finance is the study of how investors allocate their assets over time under conditions of certainty and uncertainty and typically examines the relationship between money time and risk.

Evaluación de Decisiones Estratégicas,Entre más irreversibles son las decisiones que un proyecto involucra mayor esfuerzo debe asignarse a la valorización de sus distintas alternativas. Este curso muestra como evaluar proyectos utilizando las...,Este curso muestra como evaluar proyectos utilizando las metodologías financieras tradicionales de flujos de caja descontados incorporando en las valorizaciones las consideraciones estratégicas y haciendo uso de toda la información disponible. Este curso gratuito de cinco semanas está orientado a todos los que hablan español que desean mejorar sus competencias en la toma de decisiones estratégicas en el panorama empresarial y establecer simultáneamente redes con hispano parlantes alrededor de todo el mundo. Los estudiantes desarrollarán un proyecto trabajando en equipo a distancia y habrá retroalimentación entre los diferentes grupos. Enseña como construir un flujo de caja y como calcular su valor actualizado neto (VAN) y otros indicadores de su rentabilidad. Cubre temas conceptuales como los costos y beneficios pertinentes. También aspectos prácticos como el tratamiento de la depreciación la estimación del capital de trabajo y la determinación del horizonte de evaluación y del valor residual. Y cubre asuntos más técnicos como el cálculo de la tasa con la que se deben descontar los flujos o costo del capital. Se explica como incorporar en la evaluación los aspectos estratégicos del proyecto. Enseña como valorizar su ventaja competitiva y como incorporar las fuerzas que atentan contra la sustentación de las rentabilidades en el tiempo: la imitación la sustitución y otras. Y explica como valorizar la flexibilidad inherente al proyecto de ampliarse si se reciben buenas noticias y de reducirse en caso contrario. El curso muestra también como hacer uso de la información disponible en la industria en los estados financieros y en los precios de mercado. Respecto a estos precios se explica por ejemplo el método de valorización por múltiplos. Este permite definir un rango para el valor del proyecto directamente a partir de información del mercado financiero de precios de acciones de empresas comparables cuando estas empresas existen. El curso resalta las mejores prácticas en la construcción de los flujos de cajas en la incorporación de la estrategia y en la recolección de la información. Por ejemplo a la hora de definir un proyecto se recomienda no combinar decisiones separables y no separar proyectos complementarios o competitivos. El curso hace amplio uso de casos para introducir las materias en forma realista y estimulante.  **Tareas individuales y grupales** Los alumnos deberán estudiar en línea los videos y lecturas de las 5 clases (una cada semana) y evaluar grupalmente un proyecto real propuesto por los mismos alumnos. Los grupos serán de 6 participantes. Tu puedes traer tu grupo al curso.

El curso no tiene prerrequisitos. Es útil tener la capacidad de hacer una presentación en powerpoint y tener algún conocimiento de matemática financiera. **Requerimientos técnicos** Necesitaras un computador con conexión a internet para ver los videos y leer las lecturas. Deberás trabajar a distancia con los otros miembros de tu grupo comunicándote a través de internet usando email y skype por ejemplo. **Reconocimiento de participación** Los alumnos que completen el curso con un resultado satisfactorio recibirán un certificado de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile reconociendo su participación. ,https://novoed.com/decisiones-1-2014,https://www.youtube.com/embed/81ceQjqr17M?vq=auto&rel=0&showinfo=0&autohide=1&wmode=transparent&origin=https://novoed.com,2014-04-01,5,https://d2d6mu5qcvgbk5.cloudfront.net/courses/cover_photos/588a20d88b5f600500af3cc6658a8e16d176517c.png?1387435769,N/A,http://www.claseejecutiva.cl/,0,English,no,Profesor de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,04-20-2014

The new standards specifically describe the...,The Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards emphasize improving the quality of student-to-student discourse as a major feature of instruction. The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions jigsaws and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This short course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students' abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards.      This course consists of four sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students’ conversation during lessons. Finally we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity.      Please note that this is a slightly modified version of a previous course offered in Fall 2013. This course is targeted towards secondary school teachers.      We hope you will join us on this exciting journey.        Prerequisites   In order to participate in the course you will need to have access to a classroom in which you or the teacher you are observing are able to collect short samples of paired student talk two different times.   Frequently Asked Questions   Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment? This course may be taken for a free statement of accomplishment.   How much of the time commitment will this course be? Online work will take around 1 hour per week; assignments will take around 1 hour per week.   Any additional textbooks or software required? No.   Syllabus   Weeks 1-2: Constructive Conversations I   In these two weeks we dive into what high-quality talk between students can sound like in lessons that effectively teach the new standards. Specifically we focus on the features of “constructive interactions” during which students create clarify support and negotiate ideas as they talk about concepts and build understandings in a discipline.   Weeks 3-4: Teaching the Constructive Conversation Skills   These two weeks focus on instruction to support rich interaction introduced in Module 1. We analyze video clips that show teaching that fosters interaction skills described in the new standards. We look at activities that help students build interactions skills for staying focused on objectives building and negotiating ideas and clarifying ideas.   Weeks 5-6: Constructive Conversations II   These two weeks we will look more in depth at how to foster student interactions that build the learning of lesson objectives challenge thinking and push students to use more complex language of the Common Core standards.   Week 7: Collaboration Communication and Community   This will be a summative week when we will pull together everything we’ve covered in the course to create a product that communicates to other teachers the value of having a discourse focus for implementing the new standards. You will also consider next steps for applying and collaborating in this work during the year.    ,https://novoed.com/classroom-conversations-secondary,https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_vw7Ne-tGw?vq=auto&rel=0&showinfo=0&autohide=1&wmode=transparent&origin=https://novoed.com,2014-03-06,5,https://d2d6mu5qcvgbk5.cloudfront.net/courses/cover_photos/165f604ec29ec9ca03546499e00fce888002cee2.png?1388079347,N/A,http://online.stanford.edu/courses,0,English,no,Stanford University,04-20-2014

Should reading watching memorizing facts and then taking exams be the only way to learn? Or could technology (used effectively) make learning more interactive collaborative and constructive? Could learning be more engaging and fun? We construct access visualize and share information and knowledge in very different ways than we did decades ago. The amount and types of information created shared and critiqued every day is growing exponentially and many skills required in today’s working environment are not taught in formal school systems. In this more complex and highly-connected world we need new training and competency development—we need to design a new learning environment. The ultimate goal of this project-based course is to promote systematic design thinking that will cause a paradigm shift in the learning environments of today and tomorrow. Participants are not required to have computer programming skills but must have 1) a commitment to working in a virtual team and 2) the motivation to help people learn better. All of us have been involved in the learning process at some point in our lives; in this course we invite educators school leaders researchers students parents entrepreneurs computer programmers illustrators interface designers and all those who are interested in working together to create a new learning environment. After the completion of this course students will be able to: - Identify advantages disadvantages limitations and potentials of at least 10 interactive learning models and solutions. - Describe how online communication collaboration and visualization technology play a role in the behavioral cognitive constructivist and social dimensions of learning. - Describe the major components and processes involved in development of interactive education systems. - Communicate rationales of learning technology design approaches through team-oriented collaborations. - Evaluate the value of ideas principles and techniques used in educational media or systems. As a Final Team Project students will design a new learning model catering to 21st century environments and learners. Each self-formed team will design and develop an application or system that combines team interaction activities and learning support features in ways that are effective and appropriate for today's computing and communication devices. Students must consider potential idiosyncrasies with various learning devices (e.g. tablet phone PC) infrastructure requirements (e.g. cellular network wi-fi Bluetooth) and any special hypothetical circumstances if relevant. In addition each team must create and defend a business model (non-profit for-profit or hybrid) for the launch and scale up their solution. Additional consideration will be given to teams that come up with system feature ideas presenting meaningful learning interaction and performance analytics.  Schedule The course runs from Oct 15 - Dec 20 2012. Workload 4 hours a week. Technical Requirements You need a computer that allows you to watch the video lectures and the ability to upload your assignments which will be digital artifacts such as powerpoint or video presentations.

Finance,This class introduces the basic concepts of modern finance and their practical application. Learn about financial markets and securities how to rank investment alternatives use different interest rates immunize a...,We live in an uncertain world. Every day we need to make decisions about alternatives whose consequences cannot be predicted with certainty. Here are a few examples: In each of these situations you need to commit resources (time money effort etc.) in the face of uncertainty about the future. This course develops concepts and tools to address these types of situations. The focus is on basic principles and how they are applied in practice. No prior knowledge of finance required. A basic preparation in mathematics (probability statistics and optimization) is desirable; however many technical concepts and tools will be developed or reviewed in the course. The course is appropriate for engineering or science students wishing to apply their quantitative skills to develop a basic understanding of financial modeling and markets. This is a 10 week course. There will be several short (5-30 minutes) lectures each week. Challenges covering the lecture material will be given each week. There will also be two projects that involve real financial data. Solutions will be posted online. Submissions will be evaluated by fellow participants. The following topics will be covered:   Workload   5 hours per week.

These are three topics that build on the same...,In this research-oriented graduate course we will study algorithms for graph partitioning and clustering constructions of expander graphs and analysis of random walks. These are three topics that build on the same mathematical background and that have several important connections: for example it is possible to find graph clusters via random walks and it is possible to use the linear programming approach to graph partitioning as a way to study random walks.   We will study spectral graph theory which explains how certain combinatorial properties of graphs are related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix and we will use it describe and analyze spectral algorithms for graph partitioning and clustering. Spectral graph theory will recur as an important tool in the rest of the course. We we will also discuss other approaches to graph partitioning via linear programming and semidefinite programming. Then we will study constructions of expander graphs which are graphs with very strong pseudorandomness properties which are useful in many applications including in cryptography in complexity theory in algorithms and data structures and in coding theory. Finally we will study the mixing time of random walks a problem that comes up in several applications including the analysis of the convergence time of certain randomized algorithms such as the Metropolis algorithm.

Using case studies we will examine strategic decisions and best practices in new product and process development when environmental and resource externalities are accounted for. Environmental sustainability has emerged as the imperative management undertaking for business sustainability in the face of rising global demand for natural resources and environment services and of environmental problems such as climate change. We will examine how regulatory and voluntary requirements for sustainable development affect the ability of a firm to achieve its business and corporate objectives. We will assess how sustainable products and operational practices contribute to the firm’s competitive advantage and operational efficiency and to enabling entrepreneurial opportunities. Students will examine the industrial ecology and life cycle assessment techniques in integrating traditional product and process development requirements with those of the environment and society. The emphasis in this course is on sustainability requirements in management of new product and process development from the perspective of the senior-level executive who is responsible for the firm’s business and operational strategies. Student teams will develop a new sustainable product or undertake field study projects to gain firsthand experience with sustainability practices in a company.

This methodology for...,All humans are born as creative beings but as we grow up school and work offer few opportunities to cultivate and apply our creativity. At Stanford’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design - known as the d.school - students of all disciplines learn the design thinking process as a methodology for creative and human-centered problem solving that empowers them to collaborate across disciplines and tackle the world’s biggest challenges. In this experiential course - free and open to all - you will learn the design thinking process by tackling a real world innovation challenge. As preparation for each stage of the challenge you will explore the main design thinking concepts through short videos each paired with brief activities to practice relevant methods and approaches. There will be one weekly assignment reporting on your progress as well as weekly Google hangouts with the instructor. On the last week of the course you will apply the process to your own context and challenges while hearing from experts who use design thinking to innovate in differents fields such as healthcare and education. By the end of the course you will have learned through experience the mindsets and basic tools for each stage of the design thinking process: Empathize: understanding the needs of those you are designing for.  Define: framing problems as opportunities for creative solutions. Ideate: generating a range of possible solutions.  Prototype: communicating the core elements of solutions to others. Test: learning what works and doesn’t work to improve solutions. While you will work on the course challenge as an individual you will interact with other like-minded participants from around the world to share your experiences and exchange feedback along the way. Developing self-reflection habits and the ability for effective peer-to-peer interactions are also important learning outcomes of the course. Please join our learning community!
